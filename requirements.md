# AI Prompt Generator CLI - Requirements

## Overview

The AI Prompt Generator CLI is a command-line tool written in Rust that helps users create more effective prompts for AI systems. The tool analyzes user-provided prompts, asks follow-up questions when necessary, and generates improved prompts based on the collected information.

## Goals

- Simplify the process of creating effective AI prompts
- Provide interactive guidance through follow-up questions
- Generate high-quality prompts that yield better AI responses
- Offer a user-friendly command-line interface

## Target Users

- AI practitioners
- Developers working with AI models
- Content creators using AI tools
- Researchers exploring AI capabilities

## Features

### Core Features

1. **Prompt Analysis**

   - Accept initial prompts via command-line arguments or interactive input
   - Analyze prompts for completeness, clarity, and effectiveness
   - Identify missing elements or areas for improvement

2. **Interactive Follow-up**

   - Dynamically generate relevant follow-up questions based on initial prompt analysis
   - Present questions in a clear, user-friendly format
   - Support free-form text responses

3. **Prompt Enhancement**

   - Generate improved prompts based on the initial input and follow-up answers
   - Format prompts according to best practices for AI models
   - Provide explanations for improvements when requested

4. **User Experience**
   - Colorful, easy-to-read terminal output
   - Progress indicators for longer operations
   - Clear distinction between system messages and generated content

### Additional Features

1. **Prompt Templates**

   - Support for common prompt patterns/templates
   - Ability to save and reuse custom templates

2. **History Management**

   - Save generated prompts for future reference
   - Ability to view and reuse previous prompts

3. **Export Options**

   - Export generated prompts to files
   - Support for various formats (plain text, markdown, JSON)

4. **Configuration**
   - Customizable settings via config file
   - Adjustable verbosity levels

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

- `clap`: Command-line argument parsing
- `dialoguer`: Interactive terminal prompts
- `reqwest`: HTTP client for API communication
- `serde`: JSON serialization/deserialization
- `tokio`: Async runtime support
- `colored`: Terminal text styling

### API Integration

- Integration with AI models for prompt analysis
- Ability to send/receive data via HTTP API
- Proper error handling for API communication

### Performance Requirements

- Fast response time for local operations (< 1 second)
- Clear indication of progress for network-dependent operations
- Low memory footprint suitable for command-line use

### Security Requirements

- Secure handling of potentially sensitive prompt content
- Optional local-only mode that doesn't require network connectivity
- Clear disclosure of any data sharing with external services

## User Flows

### Basic Flow

1. User launches tool with an initial prompt or empty prompt
2. System analyzes the prompt
3. If incomplete, system asks follow-up questions
4. User answers questions
5. System generates improved prompt
6. User receives final prompt ready for use

### Advanced Flow

1. User launches tool with configuration options
2. User selects a prompt template or starts from scratch
3. System guides through template-specific questions
4. User answers questions and provides additional context
5. System generates initial improved prompt
6. User reviews and requests further refinements
7. System applies refinements and produces final prompt
8. User exports prompt to desired format

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP

- Basic command-line interface
- Simple prompt analysis logic
- Follow-up question generation
- Improved prompt formatting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- Template support
- History management
- Configuration options
- Improved analysis algorithms

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities

- Integration with multiple AI models
- Advanced prompt optimization strategies
- Collaborative features (prompt sharing)
- Metrics for prompt effectiveness

## Success Criteria

- Users can generate significantly better prompts compared to their initial attempts
- The tool is intuitive enough for non-technical users
- Follow-up questions are relevant and helpful
- The improved prompts consistently yield better AI responses

## Limitations & Constraints

- The tool requires network connectivity for AI-powered analysis
- Quality of the improved prompts depends on the underlying AI model
- The tool doesn't guarantee optimal results for highly specialized domains without specific training
